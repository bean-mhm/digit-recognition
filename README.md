This is my attempt at training an artificial neural network to recognize
handwritten digits with C++.

This project uses the
[MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
for training and testing a neural network. The dataset is not included in the
repository for license issues. The user can put the necessary files in the same
directory as the output binaries at their own risk.
